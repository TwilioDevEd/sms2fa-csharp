# SMS Two-Factor Authentication

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/bi338rcmhm1x9bx4?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/TwilioDevEd/sms2fa-csharp)

SMS Two-Factor Authentication (SMS-2FA) helps keep your user accounts secure by
validating two "factors" of identity. Most login systems only validate a password
known by the user. You can make it harder for evildoers to compromise a user
account by also validating something a user has, such as their mobile phone.
